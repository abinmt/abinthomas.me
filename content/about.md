Hey, thanks for stopping by, I am [Abin Mathew Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abinmathewthomas/) a Software Engineer, who hails from Kerala, India and living in Pune, India. Currently, I work as a Director of Development with [Xento Systems](http://www.xento.com/what-we-do/), a technology solutions provider for [Entrata, Inc](https://www.entrata.com/)., the leading provider of property management software in the United States. In this role, my primary responsibility is to lead and empower a Business Unit of 150+ resources.

I consider myself as a student for the lifetime and over last 13 years, I have been building back-end web applications using PHP, Postgresql. My interests are not only in Technology but also in Leadership, Masterminding Strategies, Investment, Travel/Driving, Food/Cooking and Spiritual. Here through this blog, my aim is to spread the knowledge I have gained so far.

Here’s what I believe:

* That Old saying “A pen is mightier than a sword”.

* People who proudly declare that they don’t read/upgrade themselves make me nervous.

* Be Full Stack, blur the edges of your profession, a Web Developer should be knowing javascript, NodeJs, PHP, Python, database, DevOps, infrastructure management etc.

* Agile and KISS 😀

* Content rather than presentation and representation.

* Everything can be improvised upon, so the statements “A perfect solution”, “Optimized code”, “The right way of doing it”, “A perfect decision” etc are relative. Constraint the solutions with the Time, Cost and Scope, pick the most feasible one and move on.

* Situational Leadership.

* Be Data-Centric, however, validate the data before taking any decision.

* GOD exists!
